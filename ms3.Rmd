ABOUT MY PROJECT

I have updated my project to be a coronavirus tracker. In my project, I am using data sets from WHO and CDC to create visualisations and analyse the spread of coronavirus in the world.
The first dataset fromWHo gives a daily track of coronavirus cases.
The seocnd dataset from CDC gives a sprea do fthe coronavirus cases in the US.

Through this, I will be able to compare the daily sprad of coronavirus globally and contrast it with the spread in America.
